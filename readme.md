<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is an interactive map of the United States electoral college. You can select a color (if you don't it will simply cycle through the options) and click on states to color them respetively, in order to calculate a mock presidential election. You can also click the visualize button to view the states based on point density, so states that carry more weight in points will appear darker.
